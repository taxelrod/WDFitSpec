About this version
------------------
Version 1.3.2 has been modified to use a new Version 4 format for TGM files,
which is optimized for WD models.

Support for previous formats (V1 through V3) has been removed.


Package ULySS
-------------

Purpose: Analyse astronomical spectra; parametric local minimization
Language: IDL/GDL
Author: Mina Koleva et al., University of Lyon, licence GPL
References: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...501.1269K

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The package consists in IDL programs, models (FITS files), data provided
for examples and documentation.

The principle of this analysis is to compare an observed spectrum of a
stellar population and compare it with a model in order to derive (i)
the characteristics of the stellar population (age and metallicity; parameters
of the model) and (ii) the internal kinematics (convolution by the
Line-of-sight velocity distribution).

The method is described in different papers, in particular:
http://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.2979v1


INSTALLATION
------------

Get the tarball and detar it.

On Unix/Linux type: make install
This run a configuration script and generate the file pgm/uly_startup.pro
setting some variables to values fittedt to the local installation

On Windows, check in the file pgm/uly_startup.pro.in, and guess what you have 
to do.
Note that on MS/Windows a couple of program files may have to be modified 
because of the difference of path separator in file names.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

ULySS depends on the following third pary code, included in the dep/
directory, for version compatibility:
  - Craig Markwardt: http://cow.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/idl.html
    dep/mpfit.pro   Levenberg-Marquart minimization
  - David Fanning: http://www.dfanning.com/programs/fsc_color.pro
    dep/fsc_color.pro

ULySS uses several function from the IDL astro library
   http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/
which shall be installed separately.

HTML DOCUMENTATION AND TUTORIALS (for the developers)
-----------------------------------------------------

This section is to help the developers to understand the management of the
documentation and of the tutorials.

The HTML documentation is based on the embedded documentation blocs.
Those are extracted and processed when the command: "make doc" is issued,
the html rendered sources are also generated in the same time.
The IDL functions ULY_HTML_HELP and PRO2HTML are used for this purpose.

The HTML files contain some SSI directives (to be processed by the http
server) to include the header of the page (doc/header.html) ...
A javascript script is also referred and provided in the doc directory.
The file doc/ulyss.css define the style for all the site.

The maintenance and generation of the tutorials is more complex.
There are 5 tutorials whose HTML template are in doc/tuto_*.html.
These files contain the explanations and include (SSI directives)
the pieces of GDL/IDL code (*.html_include) as well as the copy
of the terminal after these commands (tuto_*scr*.txt) and the
graphics (tuto_*img*.jpg).

The pieces of codes are maintened in separate files: tuto/tuto_*.pro.

The files (tuto_*scr*.txt) and (tuto_*img*.jpg) are generated when the
file tuto/tuto.pro is played.

All the tutorials are build with the command : make tut
It plays tuto/tuto.pro and run PRO2HTML to generate the  (*.html_include).

To view the web pages, the http server must be configured to process
the SSI (server side includes). But the pages released on the web
are pure html generated by copying with wget a master site where
the SSI are processed.


USING THE CVS (for the developers)
----------------------------------

The ULySS package is presently maintened on a CVS (an account is required):

CVSROOT=<user>@galaxies.univ-lyon1.fr:/home/prugniel/cvs/ulyss"

To use this CVS, you can conveniently do:

You can first install it with a check_out as:
> cvs -d <user>@galaxies.univ-lyon1.fr:/home/prugniel/cvs/ulyss co ulyss

Before starting of work session, be sure that you have the last version by 
doing:
> cvs up

After you made modifications, commit your changes:
> cvs commit
